### Some more testing

Let's look at some blockquotes:

> This is a normal blockquote.

<blockquote class="info">
    This is an 'info' blockquote. It is created using HTML, not Markdown.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="warning">
    This is a 'warning' blockquote. It is also created using HTML.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="success">
    This is a 'success' blockquote. It is also created using HTML.
</blockquote>

### Code

First, `some inline code`. And then, some blocks:

```elixir
defmodule Sort do
  def qsort([]), do: []
  def qsort([h | t]) do
    {lesser, greater} = Enum.split_with(t, &(&1 < h))
    qsort(lesser) ++ [h] ++ qsort(greater)
  end
end
```

And another:

```python
def ack(m, n):
   return (n + 1) if m == 0 else (
      ack(m-1, 1) if n == 0 else ack(m-1, ack(m, n-1)))
```

Here is a <a href="/">hyperlink</a> for you.
