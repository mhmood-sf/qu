## this blog

I'm not sure what to write here; it's just another blog. I write about my opinions and likes and dislikes and put them here. Expect mostly CS-related content here, with some other random topics occasionally mixed in.

## me

Here's a list of some facts about me:

- My favourite colours are `#9dffbe` and `#ff3f69`;
  - The first is a light pastel greenish colour. The second is a pastel reddish colour. I like pastel colours in general, really.

- I prefer putting cereal in my bowl before milk;
  - This way you get more cereal per volume in your milk. If you add milk first, the cereal will just float on top instead.
  - That said, I don't very often eat cereal for breakfast.

- My favourite subjects are Maths, CS, and Physics;
  - In that order.

- I enjoy watching football (soccer) and sometimes cricket;
  - My favourite team is Manchester United.
  - I also like playing badminton.

- I like lists and conciseness.
