## this blog

I'm not sure what to write here; it's just another blog. I write about my opinions and likes and dislikes and put them here. Expect mostly CS-related content here, with some other random topics occasionally mixed in.

## me

Hello! If you haven't already noticed, I (usually) go by quantomistro on the internet. I don't remember why I chose "quantomistro", but I'm pretty sure it involved some random word generators and my fascination of astronomy and quantum physics and quantum computing and quantum-anything.

Here's a list of some facts about me:

- My favorite colors are `#9dffbe` and `#ff3f69`;
  - The first is a light pastel greenish color. The second is a pastel red-ish color. I like pastel colors in general, really.

- I prefer putting cereal in my bowl before milk;
  - This way you get more cereal per volume in your milk. If you add milk first, the cereal will just float on top instead.
  - That said, I don't very often eat cereal for breakfast.

- My favorite subjects are Math, CS, and Physics;
  - In that order.

- I enjoy watching football (soccer) and sometimes cricket;
  - My favorite team is Manchester United.
  - I also like playing badminton.

- I like lists and conciseness.
